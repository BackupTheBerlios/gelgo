PLEASE NOTE: This is pre-alpha, and doesn't work yet.  Not all of the 
functionality has been written, and just about everything that has been
needs to be re-written.

Jello Go is a client / server Go system.  It started as an academic project,
and now it is a platform for experimentation and a good way to kill time.  

Licensing: All files in the directories of "core", and "network/general" are
release under the LGPL.  All other files are released under the GPL.


Following is the old README file:
The following source files and documentation comprise our JavaGo core.
Compilation can be done by typing "javac *.java" on a shell prompt, and
following that with "java TestDriver", which will run the tests. Currently,
this core is capable of playing a game, but the tests simply verify the 
functionality of this core, and do not actually play a game.

Javadoc documentation is best generated by doing a:
	$ cd doc/
	$ ./docGen 

The Jello Team consists of:
	Anthony Benjamin
	Deanna DePriest
	Nathan Pauley
	Noah Medling
	Mike McConnell
