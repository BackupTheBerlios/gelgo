Client / Server command set:
	Command Strings are stored in GoServerCommand.command
	Command Parameters are stored in GoServerCommand.cData
	Table ids are stored in GoServerCommand.gId
	
	Game ids and table ids are the same thing (since there is only one game per table and only one table per game).
	Game / table ids are provided in all commands.
	Any communication on the server level will get the game / table id of '-1'
	The game / table id of '0' is reserved for server commands that may be implemented some day.
	
	not implemented in this command set is pre-game negotiation, watchers of tables, and saved games / players.
	this is the minimum that is needed to make Noah's gui work.
